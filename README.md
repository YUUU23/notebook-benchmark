# notebook-benchmark

`benchmarks` contains various Jupyter python notebooks for reactivity services to test their reactive kernel.
`jupyter-run` automates benchmark testing process by simulating notebook modifications with Playwright through the Jupyter Galata framework, returning results for how many cells reran and correctness diff.

1. Install dependencies

```bash
jlpm install
jlpm playwright install
```

**Ensure the kernel you would like to use with is pre-installed!**

2. Benchmark directories should be structured such that each subdirectory contains one benchmark describing one notebook modification,

```
benchmarks/py_built_in/
├── list_pop/
│   └── list_pop.ipynb/ # Original notebook
│   └── m_list_pop.ipynb/ # Notebook containing one modification
├── list_concat/
│   └── list_concat.ipynb/
│   └── m_list_concat.ipynb/
| ...
```

Provide a directory containing notebooks to `jupyter-run/scripts/preprocess.sh` to generate subdirectories as above. **Modification to notebooks still need to be edited manually before running benchmarks!**

3. Configuration files can be edited in `jupyter-run/config/`

```
jupyter-run/config/
├── jupyter_server_test_config.py # Configure kernel jupyter notebooks in UI are ran with
├── kernel_config.json/ # Modify kernel notebooks should be ran with
├── playwright.config.js/ # Playwright config
```

4. To run one benchmark, from root, run,

```bash
cd jupyter-run
./main.py -c ./config -s ../benchmarks/py_built_in/list_pop --auto_cleanup --start_ui_kernel
```

To run all benchmarks under one directory, from root, run,

```bash
cd jupyter-run
./main.py -c ./config -m ../benchmarks/py_built_in --auto_cleanup --start_ui_kernel
```

**The above configures such that a Jupyter kernel for UI interaction will be started automatically, and UI kernel are shutdown afterwards with intermediate testing files and configs removed.**

Intermediate files generated by running each benchmark include,

```
jupyter-run/reactive-results/
├── reactive/
│   └── list_pop.ipynb/ # Notebook after modification and reran
│   ...
├── initial/
│   └── list_pop.ipynb/ # Notebook before modification
│   ...
jupyter-run/config/
├── mod_config_file.json # Describes cell modification with metadata for playwright (overwritten by newest run)
```
